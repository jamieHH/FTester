# Device Sensor Tester
This is a site I developed and hosted at home so I could use this at my job. I test a wide range of devices on a daily basis such as laptops, tablets and smartphones. I hosted this site to help me access an easy way to test as many device sensors as a browser would allow me to in the shortest time possible. 
* External devices will also appear in the dropdowns for testing
## Camera Test
Select a camera input from a dropdown list to test the quality and specs of the camera. You will be presented with a live video feed and a list of specs of the selected hardware. 
## Microphone Test
Select your microphone input. Use the volume indicator to verify that your microphone is picking up audio. Take a recording if you are unsure and listen to the playback if you are unsure. If the sound indicator is high but you cannot hear the audio very well, check out the speaker test. Maybe the speakers are at fault.
## Speaker Test
Select you output device and check both the left and the right channels are playing and at the same volume. In a mobile device if this seems quiet you may also want to make sure the microphone is picking up audio as they are usually located in a similar place.
## Keyboard Test
A keyboard will display at the bottom and will highlight keys that have been typed whilst on the webpage. You may want to reset the logs if you want a dedicated keyboard test.
